Backlog:

* Write tests for 100% coverage
* Add tests for anything where scrub marks blocks as invalid (source changed,
  bitrod in backup, ...
* Check if we really should do image.close() ioctx.close() cluster.shutdown() as
  recommended in http://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/rbd/librbdpy/
* Add timing for reads and writes to be able to find bottlenecks in storage
* For restoring add a writer queue
* Use less memory

Next:

* Change lock lib to be a wrapper, possibly with a context manager
* Add shell scripting to exports so that a shell script can restore any backup
* Fix: Locking levaes lock files. Delete it on _unlock in locking.py:42.

Idea:

* Provide a block device for mirror writes which *only* tracks changed
  blocks for diff backups
